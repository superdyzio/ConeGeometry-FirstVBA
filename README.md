# ConeGeometry-FirstVBA

It's my first Visual Basic application, written for my colleague just to help her pass some course.

<b>How to use it?</b></br>
In main form user is supposed to specify X and Y coordinates of center of the cone base, its radius and cone height. All this values can be set with step of 0,1. When all values are provided "Calculate volume" button shows up. When volume is calculated (result appears in text box below buttons) "Draw" button becomes available. After clicking "Draw" user gets two more windows with two different projections of the cone. Every fifth line on the axes is longer than the rest to make it easier to read coordinates. Also the red lines have only supportive role. In case of generating a cone, which projections do not fit in the designated area proper message will be displayed and the windows will not appear.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me.
